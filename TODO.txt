- seems to crash when repeating insert coins with "5"
- hide title at start like the original

minor/optims:

- make it work with CD32load without the hack. Stack has to be relocated
  on resload calls
- pump appears on top status screen at times
- sometimes lockup at level 11 for instance, then monsters suicide, very rare
  but still happens

fix random:

bpset aaf5,,{A=0;g}
bpset 8aa0,,{A=0;PC=$8AB1;g}

don't wait for tune start
bpset A09C,,{fill 4040,20,0;g}
